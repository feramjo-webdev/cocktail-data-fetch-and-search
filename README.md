# Cocktail Data Fetch and Search App

A simple single-page vanilla JavaScript app that allows users to search and explore cocktail recipes using the [CocktailDB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/). Built with ES6 modules and fetch for API requests.

ðŸ§ª This is the initial version of my cocktail project. For a more robust and scalable version with multiple pages, React Router, and data caching via React Query, check out the newer [React Cocktail Explorer App](https://github.com/feramjo-webdev/react-cocktail-explorer-app.git).
